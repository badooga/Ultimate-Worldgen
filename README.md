## Features
The feature lists below are not exhaustive.

<details>
<summary>Terrain</summary>
Using the Tectonic and Terralith mods, this modpack completely revamps terrain generation without adding any new blocks. Similarly, the Nether and End are expanded by the Amplified Nether and Nullscape mods.

The Continents mod is also included as an optional mod in case you want to make your Overworld more spread out.

<details>
<summary>New Structures</summary>
A variety of new structures are added by mods like Dungeons and Taverns, Explorify and Hopo's Better Mineshafts/Ocean Ruins/Ruined Portals. Ranging from small illager camps to ominous blackstone spires, there is always something new to discover while exploring your world.

Furthermore, new variants of existing structures are added via the Repurposed Structures mod, adding extra variety to your adventures.
